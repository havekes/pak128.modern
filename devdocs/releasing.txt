HOW TO RELEASE
--------------


Before you start
----------------

You need the sources and makeobj as a bare minimum. Python for pakmak would be great, too, and something to zip the result is needed as well.

Compiling all the paks requires a moderately strong computer. It may take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour.

As of March 2013, the compiled pakset is ~ 400 MB and zips down to less than 100 MB. You will have to upload these 100 MB... A high performance connection helps.



Preparing the data
------------------

1) Pakset must compile completely!

2) No uncomited changes allowed in release!
	* Clear temporary/work files, revert changes, etc.
	* Alternatively, check out the repo extra just for release.

3) Update translations and commit.
	* pak128.prototype/text/

4) Update history!
	* history-pak128-svn.txt
	* pak128.prototype/doc/changelog.txt

5) Change loading bar version!
	* landscape/grounds/outside.dat

6) Build the pakset - use pakmak.py if possible.

7) Test the pakset with relevant release of program!

8) Zip the simutrans folder at "maximal power" and name the archive:
	* pak128-version--gameversion.zip
	  (eg. pak128-2.2.0--112.0.zip)



Releasing the files and announcing
----------------------------------

9) Commit your changes to version number (useful for finding release revision).

10) Upload to sourceforge.net:
	* create folder pak128 -> pak128 for XYZ (game version),
	* upload the zip there,
	* check if the file can be downloaded!

11) Create announcement on forum:
	* use previous topic as template,
	* use new links, version numbers, file sizes, svn revision,
	* the list of changes written there is mostly same as  pak128.prototype/doc/changelog.txt,
	* post in main pak128, pin the new topic,
	* unpin previous release topic.

12) Update website:
	* edit files in svn,
	* upload to 128.simutrans.com,
	* commit svn changes - after checking the web!

13) Update Simutrans release announcement on forum:
	* edit the post yourself, or
	* if you can't, give someone the *correct* links & numbers.



Clean-up after the event
------------------------

14) Check if there is still some forgotten uncommitted change!

15) Check again the release topics on forum and website. Try downloading the file from all locations where it is linked.

16) Step up the release number in landscape/grounds/outside.dat to "+nightly" & commit.

17) Party like mad (probably sleep) :D

18) Wake up and don't read about all the bugs.



Warnings
--------

Don't EVER delete the file on sourceforge and upload again with same name. The mirroring system will just screw up. Upload a new one, with new version number.

If file upload is interrupted, the file is broken. Same as above applies - you can't reuse the file name.

Test, test, test...
