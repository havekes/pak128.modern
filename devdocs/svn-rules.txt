For everyone with write svn access to 128, so far there are the following guidelines:


File names:
-----------

Summary: lowercase, ascii
Rationale: no problems with case-sensitive filesystems and OSes, same with codepage

* absolutely no non-ascii characters (eg. ·Ë¯ˆ˘ﬂ) in file names whatsoever
* no spaces, use _ instead
* don't use . dot, makeobj does not like it in image names
* lower_case is strongly preferred  to Big_Letters or CamelCase, especially for images
* try to stay within lowercase alphanumeric and -_
* all extensions (dat, png) lowercase



Objects:
--------

Summary: make sure not to break compatibility, keep together what goes together and separate what is not related, mostly in neat little pieces, provide metadata
Rationale: less annoyance, more productivity - find files by typing names & easy manipulation

* no spaces in names - goes hand in hand with rules above
* do not rename objects themselves, even if you change name of file they are in
* dat and png files that go together are in the same directory/folder
* if including something that was an addon before, make sure to add some prefix or postfix so that there can be no conflicts
* "mass production" items like vehicles and city buildings should be in one dat and png file per object, with same name as object but lowercase
* all images should have some sort of description - in image !!! - minimally object name and author's name, but feel free to write more, lots of space there...
* if possible, try not to scatter images across more files, or gather in one file images of more objects



Working with svn:
-----------------

Summary: know what you are doing, keep up to date when working, don't make life hard for others

* make sure you know what you are committing
* do not forget to add commit message describing what the change brings
* before starting any endeavour, update your working copy - so that you don't work in already deprecated environment
* do not be afraid to try things in your local copy - with svn you can quickly return to the "official" state
* try to keep commits "on topic" - when the changes belong to different categories, split them into more commits so that keeping track of what changed is easier
* if possible, optimize image file size when it changed anyway - with software such as pngcrush or optipng it is possible to reduce images typically by 15% and sometimes even 50% (but do keep them 24 bpp)
* when adding archives, try to use the strongest format available - usually bz2; zip is weakest!



All time tasks:
---------------

Summary: repair what is broken, increase information value

* "cut the crap" - there are lots of useless automatic comments as a result of using STL in the past, and we don't need them
* don't hesitate to add all kinds of informative comments of your choice wherever you feel they could help later someone else
* line breaks are cheap, time is not; don't hesitate to make dat files more readable by eg. separating freightimage groups and such
* removing bad light pixels is always good
* in dat files try to keep type, name and author at the beginning



Testing the pak:
----------------

Whatever you do, remember that ultimately the nightly server is our most important all-time "user". If something works for you, good, but if Werner says it is broken, it IS broken.
