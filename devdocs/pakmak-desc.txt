Pakmak is a python script.

It recursively scans subdirectories, reads files pakmak.tab, and acts upon commands in them.

The pakmak.tab files are composed from sections, a bit like INI files.

Sections are made by putting in lines with all letters UPPERCASE. Only commands in known sections are saved and used.

Comments are whole lines starting immediately with #.

Currently used sections are:
FOLDERS
OPTIONS
COMMANDS-BEFORE
COMMANDS-MIDDLE
COMMANDS-AFTER
COMPILE

Processing a folder/its pakmak.tab file goes so:
	First are executed commands in section COMMANDS-BEFORE, as they are found on lines.
	For every folder listed in section COMPILE,
		it is entered,
		all (eventual) .pak files innside deleted,
		makeobj invoked with no specific parameters except pak size,
		commands in section COMMANDS-MIDDLE executed,
		if merge target is defined, pak files are merged,
		result (all paks or the merged one) "lifted" into output folder,
		if cleaning is on, pak files deleted.
	Recursion into all folders listed in section FOLDERS
	Commands in section COMMANDS-AFTER are executed.

Commands are either built-in or external calls (designated by starting with @).

Makeobj must be somewhere on path, callable simply as "makeobj".
