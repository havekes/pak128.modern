Note for tunnels:

Tunnel entrances should cover (opaquely) their tile all the way to front. This is because vehicles are drawn outside and on the tunnel tile - but not inside tunnel. That means, one moment a vehicle is visible and one not. If this "switch" happens when vehicle is still visible to player, it looks bad. A gradual hiding effect can be achieved only by letting the vehicle enter/leave the tunnel before/after (dis)appearing.
