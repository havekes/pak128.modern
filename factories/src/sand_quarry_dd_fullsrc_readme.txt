How to find newest version:

1. This is/will be part of pak128 starting from version 1.4.6 (to be precise, some nightly build between 1.4.5 and 1.4.6, but I don't know which one it will be). Downloading pak128 version 1.4.6 (when it's out) or higher assures you have reasonably up-to-date version. Before 1.4.6 comes up you can probably already find this quarry in pak128 nightly.

2. You can check Simutrans forum:
http://forum.simutrans.com
and in particular the thread:
http://forum.simutrans.com/index.php?topic=2387.0
to see if there are any newer versions or to find a link to source download.

3. You can look in the

http://simutrans-germany.com/files/upload/sand_quarry_v1_0_fullsrc.zip (for pak, dat, png and the source multi-layered file) <- this is the zip file you have

Full source

This zip contains the pak file ready to be put into pak directory, dat and png files from which you can make the pak yourself using Simutrans' makeobj, and also the source files. Note: source files are in GIMP file format.
You are welcome to use whole or parts of the graphics in your own work, as long as you don't claim you did it all by yourself.

Source files:

sand_quarry_v1_0.png - the graphics file used by makeobj when making pak for the quarry
sand_quarry_v1_0.dat - the dat file that contains all the data about the factory (aside from graphics) in the text format; used by makeobj

sand_quarry_v1_0_full_layered.xcf - the original GIMP file I worked on; contains several unused layers (some are only helper layers, some are previous versions of picture parts or failed attempts)

sand_quarry_v1_0_split.xcf - all layers from the full layered file merged, unnecessary special colors purged and split into individual tiles; the cut picture is in my own template I created for this work, to conveniently arrange cut pieces into correct positions and remove overlapping parts
