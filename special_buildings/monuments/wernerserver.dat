# Werner's monument
# -----------------
# By Zeno - Sept. 4th, 2009
# The inscription and details in the details window should say something like:
#
# This monument has been raised by the Simutrans authorities in honour to 
# Werner Brandt "Wernieman", and his server. He provided the community with
# many useful services like svn, nightlies and filesharing. The funny thing is,
# when he goes away on holidays his router refuses to work and goes on holiday too.
